ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, it's great to have you here.

We're excited to help you transform your life and acheive your eCommerce dreams. I've felt how you feel now and, through my struggles growing my first business, I decided that I have a responsibility to give back - to help others grow.  

I know that first impressions are important, so I wanted to start on the right foot by sharing a number of posts that will walk you through eCommerce, dropshipping,dropsurfing, and any and all questions you might have! Take a peek below at the list of amazing resources I have for you. This is just the beginning!



__A few things you should know upfront__:
1. This blog is dedicated to helping you achieve the financial and personal independence you've been looking for. This means we're here to actively help you build a business that you can be proud of. This blog helps unlock potential in motivated, hard working individuals.
2. The blog is focused on providing detailed information to new business owners who want to grow in eCommerce. Intermediate and advanced material is available in my course (coming soon! - Sign up for my email list to get notified when it's out). The knowledge in the course is very powerful, but does require some baseline knowledge of eCommerce to obtain maximum value. For folks who just want to learn more about eCommerce and dropshipping, I've also put together a 12 day ecommerce bootcamp fully delivered via email.
3. For the best experience I recommend allocating an hour to two hours a day to study and another one to two hours for practicing the material you're learning. If you're working full time and that kind of time committment is tough for you - I would recommend taking a slower pace at 30 minutes a day for study and 30 minutes for practice but keeping up with your material every single day (that's right, *EVERY* single day including weekends).
