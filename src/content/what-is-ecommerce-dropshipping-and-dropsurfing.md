Lots of different terms get thrown around in the eCommerce space that often confuse beginners. I want to take a minute to clear this up since it's important to know the differences. 

So far I've seen the following terms thrown around quite often:

1. Dropshipping 
2. Hybrid eCommerce
3. Dropsurfing
4. Traditional eCommerce
5. Branded eCommerce
6. B2B eCommerce
7. High-ticket Dropshipping

Okay, so let's break down what each means!


__Dropshipping__ is when the store owner purchases the product after receiving an order from the customer. This means you can avoid holding inventory resulting in low startup costs and test new products quickly since you don't own or manufacture the product.

__High-ticket dropshipping__ is when you sell higher priced goods ($200+) online to customers. This strategy usually requires some sales skills as you have to call suppliers in your country to set up an account. High-ticket dropshipping is usually powered  by Google Adwords and SEO in addition to some Facebook marketing.

__Dropsurfing__ has two well known definitions (leading to more confusion among readers). Definition one is nearly the same as dropshipping except that instead of selecting one supplier to fulfill your orders with you switch suppliers based on the lowest price. The other definition of dropsurfing is similar to trend hunting. You find products or ideas that are trending and sell those to customers. Since the product is trending you don't have to worry that it isn't a "winning" product.   

__Hybrid eCommerce__ is what bigger brands like Bonobos and Target do. They have physical stores *and* an online storefront.

__Traditional eCommerce__ is what the big players do. They own the entire logistics chain and some even the manufacturing of the product. This allows them to provide better services at lower costs to customers.

__Branded eCommerce__ is simply running a eCommerce store built off a strong brand. Existing brands usually do traditional or branded eCommerce.


Okay, so which is right for you? 

On our blog we teach Dropshipping, dropsurfing, high-ticket dropshipping, and branded eCommerce. We dabble a bit in traditional eCommerce but since that's in the purview of larger companies we offer these services usually as consulting rather than blog posts or courses.
